# robocuphome_t5

This is a meta package of robocup@home class tutorial 5.

You should put it inside the tiago workspace along with tiago package and darknet_ros package in order to work together.

### Things to refine later

1. copy the world file int o tiago_simulation/tiago_gazebo/worlds/
2. change the camera_reading topic to /xtion/rgb/image_raw in darknet_ros/darknet_ros/config/ros.yaml
